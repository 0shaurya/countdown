# countdown

Hello! This simple website will count down to a specific time, configurable by the user. It is also possible to change the title (button right of the title) and the background (button in bottom left).

This was a simple but fun project, and taught me a lot about the Date objects in javascript. Adjusting for time zone differences was tricky, but I got it in the end.

Enjoy!
